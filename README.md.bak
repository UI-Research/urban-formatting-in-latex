## Original Seed Grant Proposal
**Team:** Alexandra Tammaro (COMMS) and Claire McKay Bowen (LHP)

- **Motivation:** When creating Urban reports in Word, copyeditors spend a lot of time to ensure the correct document style, text formatting, table structures, figure placements, and references are used. For highly technical, heavily referenced papers, Word can be cumbersome, quickly becoming unwieldy and elongating timelines.
- **Objective:** We propose to create Urban formatting in LaTeX, an open-source software system for various documentation, which is widely used in academia for communication and publication of scientific documents.
- **Target audience:** Editors and researchers, specifically data scientists and statisticians, whose publications focus on formulas, have extensive reference lists, or are generally more scientific or math based. 
- **Why use LaTeX?:** LaTeX streamlines the editorial process by:
	- automatically generating, updating, and organizing references
	- creating visually cleaner mathematical formulas 
	- automatically generating and updating tables, figures, sections, headings, equations, and other elements
	- displaying figures in the best possible quality (PDF and SVG)
	- automatically updating the main document when changes are made in the "style/class" file, similarly to websites
- **What about editing tools in LaTeX?:** Overleaf, an online browser interface for LaTeX, resembles Word Online and facilitates collaborating.
- **What is the impact?:** We will reduce copyediting time for highly technical and scientific and math-related products, bridging a knowledge gap between Urbanâ€™s scientists and editors. STEM disciplines expect technical documentation to be written in the LaTeX, so an Urban-branded LaTeX template would facilitate our reach into new evidence-building avenues, both in house and with outside stakeholders.
