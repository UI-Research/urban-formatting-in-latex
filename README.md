# Urban Formatting in LaTeX

**Team:** Alexandra Tammaro (COMMS) and Claire McKay Bowen (LHP)

This repository is for the LaTeX files that are in the Urban approved format.

## Repository Contents

* Research Report - a directory that contains the files for creating the Urban Institute Research Report in LaTeX.
* White Paper - a directory that contains the files for creating the Urban Institute White Paper in LaTeX.
* How-to Guides and Resources - a directory that contains resources and "How-to Guides" on how to make LaTeX documents, editing LaTeX files, and becoming familiar with Overleaf.

## Elevator Pitch
Why is use LaTeX versus Word?

**Comms:**
"LaTeX is online, code-based software that allows for greater reach for our more scientific- and math-based publications, not only in terms of researchers being able to produce them--and time-saving measures in writing and editing citation-heavy products--but also in that it's an industry favorite for academic publishing."

**Tech and Data:**
"An Urban-branded LaTeX template allows for greater collaboration across sectors and stakeholders, including other research organizations, as well as for greater reach for Urban researchers' more scientific- and math-based publications. STEM-oriented research favors LaTeX for publishing, and by having an Urban-branded product, we show we're meeting an industry standard."

## Original Seed Grant Proposal

- **Motivation:** When creating Urban reports in Word, copyeditors spend a lot of time to ensure the correct document style, text formatting, table structures, figure placements, and references are used. For highly technical, heavily referenced papers, Word can be cumbersome, quickly becoming unwieldy and elongating timelines.
- **Objective:** We propose to create Urban formatting in LaTeX, an open-source software system for various documentation, which is widely used in academia for communication and publication of scientific documents.
- **Target audience:** Editors and researchers, specifically data scientists and statisticians, whose publications focus on formulas, have extensive reference lists, or are generally more scientific or math based. 
- **Why use LaTeX?:** LaTeX streamlines the editorial process by:
	- automatically generating, updating, and organizing references
	- creating visually cleaner mathematical formulas 
	- automatically generating and updating tables, figures, sections, headings, equations, and other elements
	- displaying figures in the best possible quality (PDF and SVG)
	- automatically updating the main document when changes are made in the "style/class" file, similarly to websites
- **What about editing tools in LaTeX?:** Overleaf, an online browser interface for LaTeX, resembles Word Online and facilitates collaborating.
- **What is the impact?:** We will reduce copyediting time for highly technical and scientific and math-related products, bridging a knowledge gap between Urbanâ€™s scientists and editors. STEM disciplines expect technical documentation to be written in the LaTeX, so an Urban-branded LaTeX template would facilitate our reach into new evidence-building avenues, both in house and with outside stakeholders.
